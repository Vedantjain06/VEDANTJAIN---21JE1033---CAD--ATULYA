Hey everyone
This project is a motor controlled 4 wheel bot designed as a batmobile


It can be used for various projects like line follower , light detection bot etc

the front and back tire assembly is joined by axle in the
project but can be replaced by motor during the actual demonstration


front two wheels are textured black with 0.31m diametre each and back two are textured gloss black
with same diametre but slighly more width
 
The top view or the upper body part of the bot is left exposed and empty so that micprocessor,wires etc can be placed on it

The weight of the body is kept equally distributed between both the tires to avoid bot from wobbling

Thats all for this project
thank you !!!
